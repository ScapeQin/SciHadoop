This represents the code base used to run the experiments for the SC '11 SciHadoop paper. 
See our website for links to the paper and more details: http://systems.soe.ucsc.edu/projects/damasc

The NetCDF patches need to be applied to a 4.2 version of the NetCDF Java library for the SciHadoop code to work. Directions can be found in the netcdf_patches directory.

Installation instructions can be found on our github page, here https://github.com/four2five/SciHadoop/wiki/How-to-Build-SciHadoop
That link has instructions for installing Hadoop, patching and building NetCDF and running a SciHadoop job
