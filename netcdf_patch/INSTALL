We've also added a patch for NetCDF Java 4.3.15 as netcdf43.diff.
from the "cdm" directory, apply the patch like so:
 patch -p2 < netcdf43.diff

1) download a source verison of NetCDF 4.2. This patch was built against the package from Oct 24, 2011

2) unzip the NetCDF source somewhere

3) copy the netcdf42.diff file into the same directory as "cdm". 

4) patch with this command 'patch -p1 < netcdf42.diff

5) this should apply cleanly. If it does, then cd into the cdm directory and build the jar with this command:
'ant makeMainComplete'

6) there should now be a directory under 'cdm' called 'target'. The jar file in there called 'netcdfAll-4.2.jar is likely the one you want. You can try using netcdf-4.2.jar but we just use the "All" variant ant it works out pretty well.

7) make sure this jar is in both your CLASSPATH and HADOOP_CLASSPATH (configured in the conf/hadoop-env.sh script in your hadoop installation) for every node.
